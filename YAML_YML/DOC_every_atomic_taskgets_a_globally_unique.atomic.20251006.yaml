  title: "Every atomic task gets a globally unique ID"
  purpose: >
    Defines the Two‑ID rule that underpins the atomic workflow system.  Each atomic task is assigned a
    globally unique, permanent identifier (atom_uid) for machine referencing and a human‑readable key
    (atom_key) that is stable within its workflow.  The document explains the benefits of separating
    machine and human identifiers and provides examples.

      description: >
        Encapsulates the description of the Two‑ID rule.  It discusses the formats for atom_uid (e.g., ULID
        or UUIDv7) and atom_key (namespace/workflow/version/phase/lane/sequence) and offers guidance on
        using machine IDs for systems while keeping human keys stable.  This atom can be referenced
        whenever the Two‑ID principle needs to be explained.
