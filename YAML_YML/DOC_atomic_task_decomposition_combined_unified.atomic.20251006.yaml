  title: "Atomic Task Decomposition — Combined Unified Workflow"
  purpose: >
    Enumerates all atomic tasks defined in the combined unified pipeline (COMBINED.nested.yaml).  Each
    task represents a single‑responsibility operation assigned to a specific role across the seed draft,
    requirements, scope, architecture, contracts, decomposition, initial code generation, test
    hardening, review & compliance, release & observe, artifact translation, plan & route, and
    tool/role selection.  Branching tasks performed by different roles are listed separately.

      description: >
        Captures the entire task list for the combined unified workflow.  Tasks such as collect_context,
        derive_requirements, model_architecture, decompose, sequence, codegen, add_tests, review,
        release_plan, capture_learnings and dozens more are described with their assigned roles.
        The document provides a high‑level seed‑to‑release pipeline with bridging and planning layers.
