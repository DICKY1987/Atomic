  title: "Two‑ID Rule"
  purpose: >
    Formalizes the Two‑ID rule for atomic tasks.  The rule specifies that each atomic task must have
    a machine‑friendly, globally unique identifier (atom_uid) and a stable, human‑readable key
    (atom_key).  It details the recommended format for atom_key, including namespace, workflow slug,
    version, phase, lane, sequence, optional variant and revision suffixes, and explains why this
    separation improves stability and traceability.

      description: >
        Encapsulates the guidance on constructing atom_uid and atom_key, giving examples of ULIDs,
        UUIDv7 values and structured human keys.  It can be referenced by any process or workflow
        that needs to understand the Two‑ID convention.
