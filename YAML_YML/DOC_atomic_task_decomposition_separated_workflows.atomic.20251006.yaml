  title: "Atomic Task Decomposition – Separated Workflows"
  purpose: >
    Decomposes each workflow in the repository into its constituent atomic tasks.  The document
    enumerates the tasks for distinct orchestrators such as the Multi‑CLI Orchestrator, Free‑Tier
    Orchestrator, Routing Engine, predetermined Python editing workflow, workflow enhancements,
    simplified workflow mode, and API execution workflows.  Each atom is presented with a
    YAML‑friendly identifier and descriptive name.

      description: >
        This atom captures the full text of the document that lists atomic tasks grouped by
        orchestrator and phase.  It serves as a container for the decomposed tasks so they can
        later be converted into individual atoms.  The content includes tasks prefixed with
        mo_atom_*, ft_atom_*, rt_atom_*, pw_atom_*, wh_atom_*, sw_atom_* and ap_atom_*.
