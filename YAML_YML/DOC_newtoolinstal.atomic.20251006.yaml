  title: "New Tool Instal (Generic Atomic Workflow)"
  purpose: >
    Synthesises a tool‑agnostic atomic workflow based on installation and setup scripts.  The document
    abstracts away specific CLI installers (winget, choco, npm, pipx) and platforms (Codex, Claude,
    Gemini) and instead focuses on the logical sequence of tasks, mirroring the Generic Atomic
    Workflow with environment preparation, intake and scoping, planning, execution and validation.

      description: >
        Encapsulates the textual blueprint of a tool‑agnostic installation workflow.  It adapts the
        Generic Atomic Workflow tasks to the context of installing new tools or dependencies while
        preserving the same phases and single‑responsibility principles.  Use this as a guide when
        creating installation workflows.
