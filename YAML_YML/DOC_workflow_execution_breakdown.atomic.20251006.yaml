  title: "Workflow Execution Breakdown"
  purpose: >
    Breaks down the execution of an atomic workflow into phases and subphases.  The document lists
    atoms for initialization (environment setup, verification & sanity checks), lane preparation
    (creation of simple, moderate and complex branches), agent assignment, subsequent planning,
    execution, validation, integration and reporting.  It serves as a template for understanding how
    a complete atomic workflow runs end‑to‑end.
