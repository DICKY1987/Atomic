  title: "Atomic Task Decomposition — Combined Unified Workflow (Extended)"
  purpose: >
    Extends the combined unified workflow decomposition by introducing additional tasks for
    simultaneous execution and Git worktree isolation.  The document describes how multi‑stream
    work is created, queued, executed in parallel, merged and persisted.  New atoms numbered
    from 130 upward complement the original unified pipeline.

      description: >
        Contains the extended task list for the unified workflow, beginning with atom_130 and
        covering work stream creation, execution planning, parallel dispatch, merge queue
        management, and final verification tasks.  It references the Simultaneous Execution & Git
        Worktree workflow and preserves earlier atoms by reference.
