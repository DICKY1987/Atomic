  title: "Atomic Parallelization Breakdown"
  purpose: >
    Provides a granular breakdown of decisions for parallelizing multiâ€‘agent tasks.  The document
    emphasises maximum atomic granularity and lists a large number of atoms across phases such as
    Claude code analysis processing, codebase context extraction, user document integration and
    architectural constraint parsing.  Each atom details a single responsibility to support
    independently testable parallelization.

      description: >
        Encapsulates the full specification of the atomic parallelization breakdown.  Tasks include
        detecting analysis completion signals, validating artifacts, extracting repository structure and
        dependencies, parsing user documents, and applying architectural constraints.  This atom can
        be decomposed into smaller atoms in future iterations.
