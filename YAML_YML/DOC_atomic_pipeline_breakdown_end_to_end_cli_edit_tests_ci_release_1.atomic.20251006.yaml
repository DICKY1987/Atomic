  title: "Atomic Pipeline Breakdown – End‑to‑End (CLI Edit → Tests → CI → Release)"
  purpose: >
    Documents an end‑to‑end atomic pipeline covering command‑line editing through unit testing, continuous
    integration and final release.  It outlines the tools and applications involved (Python, PowerShell,
    Git, Node.js, Docker), recommended VS Code extensions, quality stacks for Python and PowerShell,
    and DevOps utilities.  The philosophy is to make every step an independently testable atom.

      title: "End‑to‑end pipeline documentation"
      description: >
        Contains the full breakdown of the end‑to‑end pipeline.  It describes the stack of tools,
        development environment setups, linting and testing frameworks, and best practices for
        producing reliable, reproducible releases.  This documentation can be used to derive discrete
        atomic tasks for each phase of the pipeline.
