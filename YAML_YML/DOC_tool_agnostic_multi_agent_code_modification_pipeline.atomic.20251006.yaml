  title: "Tool‑Agnostic Multi‑Agent Code Modification Pipeline"
  purpose: >
    Describes a unified atomic workflow for modifying a codebase using multiple agents and tools.  It
    defines phases such as entry point processing, complexity assessment, moddoc initialization,
    planning, routing, workspace preparation, iterative editing and execution, validation, integration,
    CI/CD, release and observation.  Tasks are expressed as YAML fragments with role assignments.

      description: >
        Contains the specification of the tool‑agnostic multi‑agent pipeline, including dozens of
        atomic tasks across phases.  Roles such as orchestrator, planning_ai, thinking_ai,
        cost_resource_manager, qa_test_agent and others are mapped to each atom.  This atom acts as a
        wrapper for the full document until individual atoms are extracted.
