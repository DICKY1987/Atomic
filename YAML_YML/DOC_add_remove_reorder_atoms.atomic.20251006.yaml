  title: "Add, Remove & Reorder Atoms"
  purpose: >
    Explains how atomic tasks can be added, removed or reordered without rewriting entire workflows.
    Leveraging the Two‑ID model, it describes strategies such as minting new atom_uids, choosing human
    keys using gap numbering or suffixes, updating dependencies, marking atoms as deprecated, and
    preserving registry entries.  The document serves as a set of guidelines for evolving workflows
    safely.
