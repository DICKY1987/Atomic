Absolutely—this framework is built so you can add/remove/reorder atoms without rewriting entire workflows. The key is the two-ID model:

atom_uid (immutable, globally unique): never changes → safe anchor for references across workflows.

atom_key (human, structured): stable most of the time, but allowed to evolve in controlled ways (phase/lane/sequence), with guardrails.

Below is how modifications work in practice, plus the rules that keep everything stable and low-effort.

How modifications work (fast, safe, no full rewrites)
1) Add a new atomic task

Goal: introduce a new step without breaking links.

Mint a new atom_uid (ULID/UUIDv7).

Choose atom_key:

Put it in the right workflow/phase/lane.

Pick the next sequence number or insert without renumbering by using:

a gap strategy (e.g., number by tens: 010, 020, 030; insert at 015), or

a suffix (003a, or 003-api) if you must slot between existing numbers.

Update deps of downstream atoms that now depend on it (use atom_uid).

Registry: append a line with {atom_uid, atom_key, legacy_id?}.

Changelog: add an entry (“Added: <atom_key> (<uid>) after <uid>”).

No other atoms change—their atom_uids remain intact, and their atom_keys don’t need to move unless you want to reshuffle phases.

2) Remove an atomic task

Goal: make it disappear safely, without breaking consumers.

In the atom file, set status: deprecated (or removed) and add superseded_by if there’s a replacement. Keep the file for one release if you need a grace period.

Registry: mark state: removed, keep the line (append-only!). Optionally add redirect_uid if there’s a successor.

Rewrite deps of any atoms that pointed to the removed atom to point to the successor; if no successor, remove the dep and add a validation note.

Changelog: “Removed: <atom_key> (<uid>), superseded by <uid?>”.

Downstream tools that still reference the old atom_uid will be caught by validation.

3) Reorder tasks (change execution order)

Goal: change order without mass renumbering.

Prefer not to renumber existing atom_keys. Instead:

Maintain a display_order (integer) in each YAML to control rendering/sequence in UIs and docs.

Or keep sequence and rely on deps to enforce the actual order.

If you must move phases/lanes, keep atom_uid, update atom_key’s phase/lane and bump -r<REV> (e.g., .../exec/all/012-r2) to record the move.

Registry: add moved: true, prev_key: ... fields for audit.

No relinking required unless order changes affect dependencies.

4) Revise semantics (meaningful changes)

Goal: evolve logic without breaking consumers silently.

If behavior changes in a backwards-compatible way:

Keep the same atom_uid, bump atom_key with a revision suffix: .../021-r2.

Add rev_notes.

If behavior change is breaking:

Mint a new atom_uid, keep the old one but mark superseded_by: <new_uid>.

Optionally copy the old atom_key with -r2 on the new atom; or give the new atom a new sequence.

Deps: only rewrite where you want consumers to adopt the new atom immediately.

5) Split one atom into many

Goal: finer granularity without invalidating history.

Keep original atom file, mark status: split, and list split_into: [uid_a, uid_b].

Create new atoms (atom_uids), give them atom_keys with adjacent sequence or suffixes (034a, 034b).

Update deps of downstream atoms to reference the new set.

Registry captures both the split marker and the new atoms.

6) Merge multiple atoms into one

Goal: simplify flow.

Create a new atom (new atom_uid), mark prior atoms as merged_into: <new_uid>.

Redirect deps as needed; leave old atoms present (deprecated) for one release if you want a soft landing.

Atomic YAML file changes (what fields change, when)

Minimal fields to support change safely:

atom_uid: 01J...ZQ            # never changes for compatible edits
atom_key: cli/dev-setup/v1/init/all/003[-r2|-api]
title: "..."
role: "..."
deps: [01J..., 01K...]        # always reference UIDs
status: active|deprecated|removed|split|merged
superseded_by: 01M...         # optional
split_into: [01N..., 01P...]  # optional
merged_into: 01Q...           # optional
display_order: 120            # optional ordering control
rev_notes: "why this changed"
legacy_id: atom_003           # optional, traceability


Add/remove/edit typically touches only:

atom_key (if phase/lane/seq/rev changes),

deps (if the graph changed),

status and any of superseded_by|split_into|merged_into,

display_order (if you want to reorder without renumbering),

rev_notes.

Registry behavior (append-only, audit-friendly)

Treat the registry as a ledger: append rows; never edit past rows.

Row shape (JSONL recommended):

{
  "atom_uid": "01J...ZQ",
  "atom_key": "cli/dev-setup/v1/init/all/003",
  "workflow": "cli/dev-setup",
  "version": "v1",
  "phase": "init",
  "lane": "all",
  "seq": "003",
  "status": "active",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-05T16:22:11Z",
  "event": "created",
  "meta": { "legacy_id": "atom_003" }
}


When something changes, append a new event row:

event: "moved" with prev_key

event: "revised" with rev: 2

event: "deprecated", event: "removed"

event: "split", split_into: []

event: "merged", merged_into: "..."

A derived “current view” index (built in CI) computes the latest state per atom_uid. The raw registry remains a full audit trail.

Guardrails that prevent churn or mass rewrites

Deps always by atom_uid → reorders/renames don’t break anything.

Use display_order to change order without touching atom_key.

Sequence gaps or suffixes → insert without renumbering.

Revisions (-r2) → evolve meaning without forced UID churn.

Soft deprecation windows → keep old atoms visible with pointers to successors.

Append-only registry → perfect audit; cheap to maintain.

Automation you’ll want (tiny but powerful)

ID minter: creates ULID/UUIDv7, stamps atom_uid.

Key builder: constructs atom_key from workflow/phase/lane/seq (+ optional suffix/rev).

Deps rewriter: converts any legacy refs → atom_uid.

Registry writer: appends ledger rows; never edits in place.

Validator (pre-commit + CI):

atom_uid present & unique

atom_key matches regex

deps point to existing UIDs

no duplicate keys in the same workflow version

Index builder (CI):

Emits /atoms.index.json (current state view) for fast lookup by atom_uid or atom_key.

When do you mint a new atom_uid vs keep the old one?

Keep atom_uid when:

Text edits / doc tweaks

Reordering via display_order

Minor compatible logic change → mark -r2 and add rev_notes

Mint new atom_uid when:

Breaking change (contract, inputs/outputs semantics)

Splitting or merging atoms

The task moves to a different conceptual identity (not just a phase shuffle)

Practical commit/message convention

When a commit implements/changes an atom:

feat(exec): add post-lint quick tests
Affects: 01J9W4...ZQ (cli/dev-setup/v1/exec/all/014)
Change: added quick test phase, deps=[01J9V..., 01J9X...]


For removals/migrations:

refactor(val): split 01J9W4...ZQ into 01J9Y...AB, 01J9Y...CD
Deprecates: 01J9W4...ZQ → split_into=[01J9Y...AB, 01J9Y...CD]

Bottom line

Yes, the framework handles adds/removes/reorders without rewriting entire workflows.

Stability comes from UID-based deps and append-only registry.

Flexibility comes from display_order, sequence gaps/suffixes, and revision suffixes.

Auditability comes from ledgered registry events and explicit status/supersession fields in each YAML.

If you want, I can sketch the exact pre-commit checks and a CI validation matrix next, so these rules are enforced automatically.
