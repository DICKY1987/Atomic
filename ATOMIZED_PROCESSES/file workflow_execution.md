The file workflow_execution.log records a full run of your agentic multi-lane development pipeline, showing what happened in each workflow phase — from initialization to CI results.

Based on the extraction, here’s a structured execution summary:

🧭 1. Initialization Phase

Tasks executed

Detected host OS and environment shell.

Loaded configuration from .ai/framework-config.yaml.

Bootstrapped local Git worktrees for each lane (simple, moderate, complex).

Validated environment (Python, Ollama, Git, VS Code).

Quota tracker initialized for free-tier AI tools (Claude, Aider, Gemini).

Outcome
✅ All environment checks passed.
🕐 Duration: ~2 minutes.
No errors detected.

⚙️ 2. Lane Preparation Phase

Tasks executed

Created and synced lanes with the integration branch.

Checked out per-lane worktrees (e.g., feature/simple-fixes, feature/moderate-ai, feature/complex-integration).

Assigned corresponding CLI agents (Aider, Codex, Claude).

Outcome
✅ 3 lanes initialized.
🕐 Duration: ~4 minutes.
No merge conflicts.

🧠 3. Execution Phase (Atomic Task Processing)

Lane: Simple Fixes

Auto-lint and format with ruff, black, and isort.

Unit tests generated via auger-python.

Minor docstring and type fixes.
✅ 25 atomic tasks completed.

Lane: Moderate AI Tasks

Aider and Codex collaboration to patch cross-file type errors.

Unit test refactoring.

Static validation with pytest, 98% pass rate.
✅ 32 atomic tasks completed.

Lane: Complex Tasks

Claude-driven multi-module code routing (based on routing_engine_code.txt).

Contextual fix planning for orchestration logic.

Validation using AI triage (Claude → Gemini fallback).
✅ 15 atomic tasks completed, 2 retries (self-healing loop success).

🧩 4. Integration & Validation Phase

Tasks executed

Sequential merge of lanes (simple → moderate → complex).

Dependency analysis and cross-module import validation.

Integration tests (pytest --integration --coverage) all passed.

Security validation with bandit, semgrep, and trivy; only 2 low-confidence warnings found.

Outcome
✅ Integration complete.
🕐 Duration: ~20 minutes.
⚠️ Minor security warnings logged (no blocking issues).
