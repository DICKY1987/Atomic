Short answer: **nope—conflicts aren’t all the same**, and **how** a conflict happened should absolutely change *how you resolve it*. Treating every conflict identically (e.g., always “ours” or always “theirs”) creates hidden regressions. The fastest, least-pain path is to route each conflict through a tiny decision tree based on its origin.

# What creates conflicts (and what “best” looks like)

Here’s a practical map from **cause → best-fit resolution policy** you can automate in your multistream pipeline.

1. **Same lines edited in parallel (pure text overlap)**

* Typical symptom: `<<<<<<<`, `=======`, `>>>>>>>`.
* Best: **semantic/structural merge** where possible (JSON/YAML/XML → keywise merge; code → formatter + function-aware tool if available). Fall back to `-X ours/theirs` *only* for low-value files.
* Automation: `.gitattributes` custom drivers (`*.json merge=json-struct`, `*.yaml merge=yaml-struct`) + `pre-commit` formatters + `git rerere`.

2. **Add/Add (both branches created the same path)**

* Symptom: “both added”.
* Best: If contents are **identical/compatible**, keep one; if **different**:

  * If file is *config/data*: structural merge into a **single file**.
  * If file is *module/code*: split or rename to unambiguous names (directory fencing).
* Automation: Pre-merge check that de-duplicates identical files; otherwise auto-rename with a deterministic suffix and open a follow-up refactor task.

3. **Delete/Modify (one removed, one edited)**

* Symptom: “deleted by us/them, modified by them/us”.
* Best: If file is **generated** or **superseded**, prefer **delete**; if it’s **hand-authored**, prefer **modify** and restore the file.
* Automation: Path rules: generated artifacts → favor delete; source files → favor keep/modify.

4. **Rename vs Modify / Rename vs Rename**

* Symptom: “rename/rename” or “rename/modify” conflicts.
* Best: Prefer the **rename** and reapply **edits** on the new path. If two renames diverge, pick one canonical name via naming rules (e.g., snake_case, folder fence) and re-stage.
* Automation: Enable rename detection (`-M` is default in merges), then scripted policy to pick the canonical name and `git mv` accordingly.

5. **Binary conflicts (images, PDFs, compiled assets)**

* Symptom: Git can’t auto-merge.
* Best: **Choose one side** deterministically (latest timestamp, branch priority), or store both and schedule a manual review.
* Automation: `.gitattributes` `binary` + path rules (`*.png binary`, `merge=theirs` for generated screenshots).

6. **Lockfiles / generated dependency graphs (e.g., `package-lock.json`, `poetry.lock`)**

* Cause: Each branch ran a different solver.
* Best: **“Theirs wins”** (or “ours” consistently), then **re-resolve** dependencies once in CI to normalize.
* Automation: `.gitattributes` `merge=theirs`; CI step reruns the resolver and commits the canonical lockfile.

7. **Whitespace/EOL/formatting-only conflicts**

* Cause: Editors/OS normalization mismatch.
* Best: Normalize **before** merge; surface only meaningful hunks.
* Automation: repo-wide `.editorconfig`, `.gitattributes` `* text=auto eol=lf`, formatters, and a pre-merge normalization job.

8. **Case-only path differences (macOS/Windows case-insensitive FS)**

* Symptom: Files differ only by case; Windows can’t represent both.
* Best: Enforce **case policy** (kebab/snake) and auto-rename one side deterministically.
* Automation: Pre-merge check that fails fast with an auto-rename patch.

9. **Submodule pointer conflicts**

* Symptom: Different SHAs for the submodule.
* Best: Choose parent branch **priority**; if both required, fast-forward or create a merge commit inside the submodule first.
* Automation: Scripted submodule reconciliation step in the merge train.

10. **Filemode/permission, LFS pointer drift**

* Best: Enforce a single policy (`core.filemode=false`, required LFS) and auto-fix in a pre-merge hook.

# Decision tree you can codify (fast + deterministic)

1. **Classify the file** (by path and type): generated, binary, structured data (JSON/YAML), code, doc/log.
2. **Check event type** (Git tells you): add/add, delete/modify, rename/rename, text overlap, binary.
3. **Apply policy**:

   * Generated/lockfiles → **theirs** (or fixed side) + CI re-generate.
   * Binary → **choose side** by branch priority or timestamp.
   * JSON/YAML → **structural merge driver**; if fails, quarantine with both payloads merged under distinct keys for manual resolution.
   * Code → **format → attempt auto-merge → rerere**. If still conflicted, quarantine only the hunk; don’t block the train.
4. **Normalize & verify**: run formatters/tests; commit with trailers describing the rule applied.
5. **Record**: `rerere` learns your manual fix; next time it’s automatic.

# When the *origin* should flip the rule

* **Rebase vs merge**: Rebases create more, smaller conflicts but keep history linear. If you rebase workstreams onto `main`, prefer **auto-resolve + rerere**; if you merge `main` into branches, consider `-X theirs` for generated areas to avoid churn.
* **Hotfix vs feature**: For hotfix branches, **main wins** on security/patch files; for feature branches, **feature wins** in its fenced directory.
* **Experimental/agents output**: For AI-generated files, treat them as **proposals**—merge only if tests pass and diffs are limited to the intended scope; otherwise auto-quarantine.

# How to wire this into your multistream pipeline (quick)

* **.gitattributes**: attach merge strategies per path (union/ours/theirs/custom).
* **Custom merge drivers**: structural merges for JSON/YAML.
* **`git rerere`**: memorize solved patterns; huge time saver across streams.
* **Merge-train script**: classify → apply rule → normalize → gate → push; quarantine branches that still need eyes so other streams keep flowing.
* **Prevention**: directory fencing, many-small-config files (vs one big), format-on-save, and lockfile policy.

# TL;DR

* **Not all conflicts are equal.** The *cause* dictates the fastest, safest resolution.
* **Encode the cause-aware policy** (file type + event type + branch intent) in repo rules and your merge train.
* **Teach Git once** (attributes, drivers, rerere) and let it reuse your past decisions.
* **Quarantine, don’t block.** If a conflict resists automation, park it with a clear label and keep the rest of the streams moving.

If you want, I can generate the drop-in `.gitattributes`, the JSON/YAML merge drivers, and a small merge-train script that implements this decision tree for your branches.
